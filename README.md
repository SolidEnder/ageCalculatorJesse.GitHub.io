Fourth Front-End Mentor commit to GitHub.

This is the first project I've done that incorporates JavaScript! It's mostly functional, however, there's some kind of issue with the final result for the days, and I'm going 
to fix that in the next update. I also plan on updating it to where the error messages show up below the inputs when the user attempts to type in alphabetical values- 
currently there's no safeguards for that, but the results do display as NaN if you type in letters into any of the inputs.
